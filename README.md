# SourceTag
A universal source code documentation tool which is simple and easy to use.

# Importance
Documentation of source code is a very rewarding task for the future development of any software project. There are many other documentation tools out there that can be used as an alternative to SourceTag. Yet with SourceTag, we believe in the importance of having consistency by providing a universal set of documentation tags which can be applied to any programming language (given of course the language supports source code commenting). 

# Our Goals
We aim to achieve one thing in SourceTag: consistency. 

The ability to use the exact same documentation tags across all your favorite programming languages makes it very convenient. Learn how to use the tags once, and apply it in all your coding languages easily.
