# SourceTag
A universal source code documentation tool which is simple and easy to use.

# Importance
Documentation of source code is a very rewarding task for the future of any program. Yes there are many other documentation tools out there such as Doxygen, etc. Yet, what makes SourceTag important is that it provides a universal set of documentation tags which may be used in all programming languages; we try to achieve consistency in SourceTag.

# Vision
The vision is simple: Making source code documentation simple and consistent regardless of programming language used.
