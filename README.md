# Welcome to _SourceTag!_
Welcome fellow developer! I appreciate you taking the time to visit this project space.
_SourceTag_ is a universal source code documentation tool which is simple and easy to use.

# Importance
Documentation of source code is a very rewarding task for the future development of any software project. Of course, there are many other tools which can be used as an alternative to SourceTag. With SourceTag however, we believe in the importance of having consistency in the way source code documentation is carried out, in all programming languages. SourceTag achieves this by providing a universal set of documentation tags which can be used in nearly all known programming languages, given the language supports _commenting._ 

# Our Goals
With _SourceTag_, we aim to achieve one thing: __Consistency!__. 

_Consistency_ in how documentation is done in _ALL_ programming languages. 

_Consistency_ in how documentation is generated for _ALL_ programming languages. 

The ability to use the exact same documentation tags across all your favorite programming languages makes it very convenient. Learn how to use the tags once, and apply it in all your coding languages easily. That is what we believe we can achieve with _SourceTag_.
